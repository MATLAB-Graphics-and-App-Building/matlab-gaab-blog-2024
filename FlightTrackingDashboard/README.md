This repository contains the MATLABÂ® code for the series of blog posts on [_Creating a Flight Tracking Dashboard_](https://blogs.mathworks.com/graphics-and-apps/2024/02/08/creating-a-flight-tracking-dashboard-part-1-visualizing-an-aircraft/), available under the [MATLAB Graphics and App Building](https://blogs.mathworks.com/graphics-and-apps/) blog.

MATLAB provides a large suite of visualization functions tailored to scientific and engineering applications. 
In addition, MATLAB enables you to develop domain-specific visualizations. 
These can be embedded in all data analytics workflows, ranging from small-scale 
interactive [tasks](https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2024b/matlab/develop-live-editor-tasks.html) 
to more complex [reports](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-report-generator.html), 
[apps](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/app-designer.html) and 
[web apps](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-web-app-server.html) 
such as dashboard-like front ends.
